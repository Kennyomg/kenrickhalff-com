Casual Development is an app development startup. The focus is to improve the everyday life of the user.

To achieve this CD looks at:

- The health of the brain from a psychological and neurological perspective.

- Making responsibilities easier and fun through systemization and gamification of tasks.

- Striving to go against wastefulness with use of Lean (Startup) principles. Using build-measure-learn cycles, minimal financial burden and a continuous learning mentality.

- Using data/feedback and ethics to drive decisions.

- Using domain, behaviour and test-driven development to write quality code.
