# About Me
- ## Youth

The years of my youth were spend on the computer. I remember going to my grandparents  because they allowed me to use their dail-up internet connection so I could play RuneScape. Why RuneScape? It used to run as a Java Applet in the browser, since I wasn't allowed to download things. I remember I was almost only mining in game. I guess that was my first experience with mining virtual currency, although I don't think my grandparents would've liked me mining crypto currency on their dail-up.

My first programming experience was with Game Maker at around age 12, when a friend was working with his brother (who was 16 and was reading with C++ for dummies) on a game called Raven Online. The brother did the networking for us and we made the levels and creatures. I distinctly remember doing a lot of menial labour, as it often can be till you discover the wonders of automation.

- ## Teens

This started a dream of making games. During my teens I took paino lessons and learned the essentials of composing. At this time anime and manga interested me, which spurred me on to practiced drawing. When I finished my VMBO-T, my options were to study something with sports,  education or programming.

These 3 options enabled me to work anywhere in the world. Sports made sense since I was taking Ninjitsu lessons. Education was in my radar because I took great joy out of explaining things to my classmates and my English has been good due to video games.

In the end I choose programming mainly because of that dream of making games. After some open days I decided to go to MBO Utrecht (at the time called ROC) because they focused the most on programming.

I applied and I made a small 1 level <Link href="/blog/2d-platformer-actionscript3"><a>2D platformer game</a></Link> in ActionScript 3 to teach myself programming before school started. I like to prepare for new things, it's how I deal with the nerves.

- ## School

Around this time a few friends asked my if I'm interested to make a game and do the programming. We started to work on <Link href="/blog/claws-of-shadow"><a>Claws of Shadow</a></Link> in Unity3d. Claws of Shadow is a 2.5D side scroller adventure game. After fleshing out the story and making the first scene, we decided to start with a game with a smaller scope called Fairwinds. <Link href="/blog/fairwinds"><a>Fairwinds</a></Link> is an 2d infinity jumper.

When volunteering for the open-day to show off what we learned during school. I showed Fairwinds to potential freshmen, it was a crowd catcher only 2nd place after Tron that was being played on the projector made by Bob and Nick.

- ### Logaholic

My first internship was at <Link href="/blog/logaholic"><a>Logaholic</a></Link>. I worked on data visualization for web traffic. Which included making a heatmap with Leafly to show where your traffic is from. To visualize traffic flow from page to page I made a D3.js graph(?). 

Logaholic was using OpenCart as their e-commerce solutions. Which I had the privilege to replace with a new Magento webshop that has intergrated subscription/recurring payment options, which was hooked up to the Logaholic account system. I continued working part-time there till school started.

- ### First time Bizzmark
Bizzmail. WordPress, Phalcon, Fullstack

At <Link href="/blog/bizzmark"><a>Bizzmark</a></Link> I had my first experience with WordPress and an actual PHP framework. BizzMail is an MailChimp competitor, which is the main service Bizzmark offers.

I worked on royalty free image search (I discovered that email clients accept animated gifs) and made some pretty impressive restaurant WordPress websites. My biggest challenge was to build a social networking platform for innovators... in WordPress. Not my preferred stack of choice, but it was interesting to make my first theme.

- ### Jouw Omgeving
React , Django, ES6

<p><Link href="/blog/jouw-omgeving"><a>Jouw Omgeving</a></Link> is a tool to aid mental health caretakers and their clients. It's essentially a digitalisation of fast library of psychological solutions. I absolutely love the design both on the front of in the back. I worked here for half a year with much delight.</p>

I learned React, Django and my first time experiencing React with the ES6 class syntax and arrow function. Also discovered that arrow functions and normal lambda functions don't bind the same way. This is also my first time using Python, which I nominate to be a Dutch national treasure.

- ### Second time Bizzmark
React, WordPress, Phalcon, Node.Js/Express, Fullstack

<p><Link href="/blog/bizzmark"><a>Bizzmark</a></Link> is back in business! Third and last internship we started strong. A team of classmates were willing to make Paul Beens ambitions a reality. Harry, Jordan and Mark build Bizzboard, a dashboarding platform. I aided Jordan with all the external APIs as data sources and helped Harry with the Bizzboard Express.js API which was boilerplated and ported to OOP (at Harry's request) from the Bizzmail API.</p>

At the same time Nick, Bart and I made Bizzmail 2: Reactive Boogalo. Bart made the backend with Express.js, gradually replacing the Phalcon backend. I helped with several API endpoints. Mainwhile, Nick and I were busy with the Front-end. Which with the acquired new React skills, we pumped out an awesome React-Redux Maturial Design UI. I made an interactive tutorial, a slick translation system using Google Translate as aid and with Bart made the editor, which is the crown piece of the application.

- ### CatRPG
C++ Spriter animation parser

<p><Link href="/blog/catrpg"><a>CatRPG</a></Link> an ambitious school project. We wanted to learn C++ and wanted to make a game. Sure we could've used a language we're comfortable with or used an engine. No, we went SFML and Spriter. As a humbling initiation into C++ compilers and trying to make a build system that worked on everyone's laptop was our first hurdle.</p>

Next up: Animations. We were hell bent on parsing the spriter files and get some working animations on screen. We actually did it. Many parsed lines of XML later and our time was up. Luckily our C++ animation parser was good enough for us to a very good grade. "A for effort" rang true for us.

- ### NHTV intake

My eyes were set on NHTV game dev course. Nick and I applied and went through the experience of an intake. Our homework was to make a game with "Honey" as theme (any interpretation of honey) in C++. So as a real gamer, I made the hit <Link href="/blog/protect-the-bees"><a>Protect The Bees</a></Link>. Nick made a tower defense game with bee's. Nick was already traumatized with math, which probably had some influence on the conclusion of the intake.
I was also working on writing a <Link href="/blog/3d-game-engine"><a>3d game engine</a></Link> with aid of a book called Game Engine Architecture and a YouTube series by TheCherno.

During the interview I was able to show Protect The Bees. We walked through my code and I was able to explain what my thought process was and what I would've done differently in hindsight. I also showed what I had so far with my game engine. Which made them curious about how I'm learning to make it. I told them about the book and series which I saw was included in their curriculem in a later year.
I was accepted by the school, but due to some documents that weren't in order I had to finish school in the first months of the new school year. Which made me miss the administrative deadline of NHTV.

- ## Professional

- ### Comsys 
Angular, Java, Frontend

After school I decided to get a job in web development. At this point most of my real world experience was in Frontend development. I replied to an interesting job offer and was contacted by a recruiter. I gave my profile and was send around the Netherlands for job interviews.
Some interviews went good and some less. I noticed that when the interview was with a tech lead, the interview goes especially well since I'm able to show and discuss code.

After weighing my options between 2 companies, I choose Comsys mainly because I like working long on a product better. <Link href="/blog/comsys"><a>Comsys</a></Link> is a telecom solution. I worked on the dashboard which was made was Angular 1 and made the live chat widget fully responsive.

- ### Social Brothers
WordPress, Frontend

At <Link href="/blog/social-brothers"><a>Social Brothers</a></Link> I made many custom WordPress themes. I worked on debuut.nl (acquired by RCE) and many of their restaurants. I made a touch screen game JBL that stood in stores. Landing pages for marketing campaigns and optimizing already existing websites.

- ### Casual Development and self-development

<p>After leaving Social Brothers I needed deep introspection on what to do with my life. 

- I always wanted to make games.
- I want to help myself and others
- I want to provide for my family

</p>

I decided that I wanted to make apps that can help people in their everyday life. These apps need to be fun and need to actually work. This is how <Link href="/casual-development"><a>Casual Development</a></Link> was born.
I made a list of every discipline that I needed to study up on. Running a company, designing and building an gamified app, marketing and data analysis. All rabit holes in their own right. At the same time I needed to develop myself in order to climb this mountain.

Books and YouTube as resources and a clear vision of what I want to achieve, made it possible to make the <Link href="/blog/casual-happiness"><a>Casual Happiness</a></Link> app (As of writing the app is best functional on PC and is not yet finished).

I split my booklist (as of yet) into personal development and professional but as often is with good information, it's often useful in various ways. Always causing overlap between personal and professional learning.

#### A few common trend I've learned are:

It's all about people and putting yourself in others their shoes. It's about understanding people better and learning how to communicate and listen.

Marketing is "sales x media". Sales is listening to people and offering a solution that works for the person.

Design and user experience (UX) is about creating an experience of the user. You need to know the user and understand how they experience your product.

Learning about the people that you serve is vital to serving them successfully. This is why it's important to test your assumptions about them as quickly as possible. In science the scientific method is used for exactly this purpose (Hypothesis -> Test -> Analyse). 

In Lean Startup you use a method inspired by the scientific method in order to test your assumptions about your product/service and your costumers. Which is called the build-measure-learn cycle. Together with Lean Analytics gives a clear and practical framework in order to learn from every "failure" in order to successfully solve problems for people. Which is very data driven.

## Now

At the moment I'm looking for work because my girlfriend and I want to rent a place together. Casual Happiness is almost done. When it's done it takes time for it to grow and evolve till the app has enough revenue for me to work on it full time. Therefore having an income and gaining experience with working at a start up or scale up would be a good next step.

I'm learning math and reading books like Clean Code to enhance my coding skills. I'm practicing speed reading because I have at least 700 books that I want to read. I got an EnChroma colourblind glasses to help me with design, so I'm learning colours again.

My name is Kenrick Halff. I'm a 28 year old guy from the Netherlands. Thank you for reading!
