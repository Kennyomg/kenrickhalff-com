# About Me
- ## Youth

The years of my youth were spend on the computer. I remember going to my grandparents  because they allowed me to use their dail-up internet connection so I could play RuneScape. Why RuneScape? It used to run as a Java Applet in the browser, since I wasn't allowed to download things. I remember I was almost only mining in game. I guess that was my first experience with mining virtual currency, although I don't think my grandparents would've liked me mining crypto currency on their dail-up.

My first programming experience was with Game Maker at around age 12, when a friend was working with his brother (who was 16 and was reading with C++ for dummies) on a game called Raven Online. The brother did the networking for us and we made the levels and creatures. I distinctly remember doing a lot of menial labour, as it often can be till you discover the wonders of automation.

- ## Teens

This started a dream of making games. During my teens I took paino lessons and learned the essentials of composing. At this time anime and manga interested me, which spurred me on to practiced drawing. When I finished my VMBO-T, my options were to study something with sports,  education or programming.

These 3 options enabled me to work anywhere in the world. Sports made sense since I was taking Ninjitsu lessons. Education was in my radar because I took great joy out of explaining things to my classmates and my English has been good due to video games.

In the end I choose programming mainly because of that dream of making games. After some open days I decided to go to MBO Utrecht (at the time called ROC) because they focused the most on programming.

I applied and I made a small 1 level 2D platformer game(?) in ActionScript 3 to teach myself programming before school started. I like to prepare for new things, it's how I deal with the nerves.

- ## School

Around this time a few friends asked my if I'm interested to make a game and do the programming. We started to work on Brutus in Unity3d. Brutus(?) is a 2.5D side scroller adventure game. After fleshing out the story and making the first scene, we decided to start with a game with a smaller scope called Fairwinds. Fairwinds(?) is an 2d infinity jumper.

When volunteering for the open-day to show off what we learned during school. I showed Fairwinds to potential freshmen, it was a crowd catcher only 2nd place after Tron that was being played on my projector made by Bob and Nick.

My first internship was at Logaholic. I worked on data visualization for web traffic. Which included making a heatmap with Leafly to show where your traffic is from. To visualize traffic flow from page to page I made a D3.js graph(?). Logaholic was using OpenCart as their e-commerce solutions. Which I had the privilege to replace with a new Magento webshop that has intergrated subscription/recurring payment options, which was hooked up to the Logaholic account system. I continued working part-time there till school started.



First time Bizzmark, Bizzmail. WordPress, Phalcon, Fullstack

At Bizzmark I had my first experience with WordPress and an actual PHP framework. Bizzmail is an MailChimp competitor. I worked on royalty free image search (I discovered that email clients accept animated gifs) and made some pretty impressive restaurant WordPress websites. My biggest challenge was to build a social networking platform for innovators... in WordPress. Not my preferred stack of choice, but it was interesting to make my first theme.

Jouw Omgeving, React , Django, ES6

Jouw Omgeving is a tool to aid mental health caretakers and their clients. It's essentially a digitalisation of fast library of psychological solutions. I absolutely love the design both on the front of in the back. I worked here for half a year with much delight.

I learned React, Django and my first time experiencing React with the ES6 class syntax and arrow function. Also discovered that arrow functions and normal lambda functions don't bind the same way. This is also my first time using Python, which I nominate to be a Dutch national treasure.

Second time Bizzmark, React, WordPress, Phalcon, Node.Js/Express, Fullstack

Bizzmark is back in business! Third and last internship we started strong. A team of classmates were willing to make Paul Beens ambitions a reality. Harry, Jordan and Mark build Bizzboard, a dashboarding platform. I aided Jordan with all the external APIs as data sources and helped Harry with the Bizzboard Express.js API which was boilerplated and ported to OOP (at Harry's request) from the Bizzmail API.

At the same time Nick, Bart and I made Bizzmail 2: Reactive Boogalo. Bart made the backend with Express.js, gradually replacing the Phalcon backend. I helped with several API endpoints. Mainwhile, Nick and I were busy with the Front-end. Which with the acquired new React skills, we pumped out an awesome React-Redux Maturial Design UI. I made an interactive tutorial, a slick translation system using Google Translate as aid and with Bart made the editor, which is the crown piece of the application.

CatRPG -> C++ Spriter animation parser

CatRPG an ambitious school project. We wanted to learn C++ and wanted to make a game. Sure we could've used a language we're comfortable with or used an engine. No, we went SFML and Spriter. As a humbling initiation into C++ compilers and trying to make a build system that worked on everyone's laptop was our first setback. Next up: Animations. We were hell bent on parsing the spriter files and get some working animations on screen. But actually did it. Many parsed lines of XML later and our time was up. Luckily our C++ animation parser was good enough for us to a very good grade. A for effort rang true for us.

NHTV intake

My eyes were set on NHTV game dev course. Nick and I applied and went through the experience of an intake. Our homework was to make a game with "Honey" as theme (any interpretation of honey) in C++. So as a real gamer, I made the hit Protect The Bees. Nick made a tower defense game with bee's. Nick was already traumatized with math, which probably had some influence on the conclusion of the intake.
