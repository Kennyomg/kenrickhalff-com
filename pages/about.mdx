# About Me
- ## Youth

The years of my youth were spend on the computer. I remember going to my grandparents  because they allowed me to use their dail-up internet connection so I could play RuneScape. Why RuneScape? It used to run as a Java Applet in the browser, since I wasn't allowed to download things. I remember I was almost only mining in game. I guess that was my first experience with mining virtual currency, although I don't think my grandparents would've liked me mining crypto currency on their dail-up.

My first programming experience was with Game Maker at around age 12, when a friend was working with his brother (who was 16 and was reading with C++ for dummies) on a game called Raven Online. The brother did the networking for us and we made the levels and creatures. I distinctly remember doing a lot of menial labour, as it often can be till you discover the wonders of automation.

- ## Teens

This started a dream of making games. During my teens I took paino lessons and learned the essentials of composing. At this time anime and manga interested me, which spurred me on to practiced drawing. When I finished my VMBO-T, my options were to study something with sports,  education or programming.

These 3 options enabled me to work anywhere in the world. Sports made sense since I was taking Ninjitsu lessons. Education was in my radar because I took great joy out of explaining things to my classmates and my English has been good due to video games.

In the end I choose programming mainly because of that dream of making games. After some open days I decided to go to MBO Utrecht (at the time called ROC) because they focused the most on programming.

I applied and I made a small 1 level 2D platformer game(?) in ActionScript 3 to teach myself programming before school started. I like to prepare for new things, it's how I deal with the nerves.

- ## School

Around this time a few friends asked my if I'm interested to make a game and do the programming. We started to work on Brutus in Unity3d. Brutus(?) is a 2.5D side scroller adventure game. After fleshing out the story and making the first scene, we decided to start with a game with a smaller scope called Fairwinds. Fairwinds(?) is an 2d infinity jumper.

When volunteering for the open-day to show off what we learned during school. I showed Fairwinds to potential freshmen, it was a crowd catcher only 2nd place after Tron that was being played on my projector made by Bob and Nick.

My first internship was at Logaholic. I worked on data visualization for web traffic. Which included making a heatmap with Leafly to show where your traffic is from. To visualize traffic flow from page to page I made a D3.js graph(?). Logaholic was using OpenCart as their e-commerce solutions. Which I had the privilege to replace with a new Magento webshop that has intergrated subscription/recurring payment options, which was hooked up to the Logaholic account system. I continued working part-time there till school started.
