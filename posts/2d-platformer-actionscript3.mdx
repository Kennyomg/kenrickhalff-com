title: 2D Platformer - in Actionscript 3
---

In preparation for programming school I wanted to make a simple game. The game objective is to  get from the top left to the bottom right of the screen by jumping from platform to platform. I spend most time in tweaking the jumping distances to be difficult. It took the whole day to beat the level.
