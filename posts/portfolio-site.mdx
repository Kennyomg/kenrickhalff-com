That's this website! I love the night sky, which is sadly hidden from me due to Dutch light pollution.

I wanted my portfolio site to be part of my portfolio. I also wanted my portfolio site to relate to me. Watching up to the moon lit sky with stars flikkering, thinking back on life, like thought clouds passing by telling the story.
