title: Casual Happiness
---

Casual Happiness is the first app for Casual Development. The Greek Wisdom and Stoic Wisdom apps which send me daily quotes by philosphers through push notifications. This helped me immensely and inspired me to make Casual Happiness.

With this app you can write and send messages to your loved ones or store them in your jar. Periodically you receive a push notification with a random message that you saved. With this app I hope to help people (especially with high neuroticism) with positive affirmation and rewire the brain to be more resilient to the harshness of everyday life.

The design of this app is meant to set the tone of other apps that will be made for Casual Development. It needs to be fun and unique but yet familiar and intuitive. I went for a realistic "physical" approach with child like elements.

You sit at a wooden desk with a rotating disk. The disk is split up in 4 sections with objects.

1. A jar containing colourful notes folded in shapes
2. A tablet to change your profile settings
3. A friendbook
4. Writing tools to write notes
