title: 3D Game Engine
---

I wanted to learn how game engines work. So I started with reading Game Engine Architecture and wachting TheCherno. Although my mathematical knowledge was lacking to fully grasp what I was doing. I did learn a lot about programming in C++ and the math of computer graphics programming.

This is a project I intend to get back to, especially now I'm leaps beyond what I was with regard to my programming and mathematical understanding.
