title: Protect The Bees
---

Oh no, the bear is trying to steal the honey that the worker bees worked so hard to collect. Quickly! Chase away the bear by sending in the soldier bees. Make worker bees to collect honey, upgrade your hive capacity and keep sending the bear back home.

This game was for an intake to NHTV game dev course. The theme was honey and C++ was required.
