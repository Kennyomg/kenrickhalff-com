title: Claws of Shadow - 2.5D side scroller in Unity3D
---

This 2.5D side scrolling adventure game was meant to take the player through different time periods as Brutus or Foxy. What we build was a working first level in Unity3d. With particles, flowing water, first time use of blender and many sprites and texture drawn by Kevin.
