title: Corona Shopper - Game
---

Pepijn and I made this game for Ludum Dare (a challenge to make a game within 72 hours). We faithfully recreated the experience of doing your groceries at the Albert Heijn Langestraat in Hilversum, Netherlands.

The objective is to get gather your groceries before they run out and make it past the register without catching the corona virus.
